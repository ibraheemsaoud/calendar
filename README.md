# calendar
Calendar with a journal attached to the side, fill all the time gabs with what you have done to have a better overview with hopefully later an AI that can help you maximize your time managment skills 

you can set goals: be more social, sharpen your skill, go back to uni, relax etc and it tries to set up a schedule 

Some events have a checklist (or a pre checklist): sleep (brush teeth)
Some events have consequences: cooking => dish washing
Events should be very very flexible.
